Initial code to calculate the area of different shapes based on user input:

This code snippet demonstrates a basic implementation of a program to calculate the area of different shapes based on user input. It prompts the user to provide a shape type (square, rectangle, or circle) and then requests the necessary parameters (e.g., side length, length and width, or radius) to compute the area of the specified shape. The program handles each shape type separately and prints the calculated area. However, the code contains some duplication and could be further optimized for better readability and maintainability.

Isolating a Parameter Request From the User:

This code snippet improves upon the initial implementation by isolating the parameter request from the user into a separate function called get_user_param(). This function prompts the user for a parameter value and performs basic validation to ensure that the input is a valid number. By abstracting the parameter request logic into its own function, the main code becomes cleaner and more modular. This enhancement reduces code duplication and makes it easier to manage parameter inputs throughout the program.

This README is identical to the first example, as it seems to describe the same code snippet. If you'd like a separate README for the third example, please provide the correct code snippet
